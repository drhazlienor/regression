# Regression Analysis
This repository contains data analysis exercises focused on identifying potential predictors of Diabetes Mellitus (DM), using both linear and logistic regression techniques.

# Dataset Description
The dataset includes 3,820 individuals with various demographic, anthropometric, and clinical measurements. It is designed to explore factors influencing:
- The presence or absence of diabetes (outcome variable: dmdx)
- The HbA1c level as a continuous marker of glycemic control (outcome variable: hba1c)

# Exercises Included
This repository provides two practical exercises:
1) Linear Regression
- Outcome variable: hba1c (continuous)
- Explore relationships between HbA1c and predictors like age, gender, BMI, cholesterol, etc.
- File: linear regression.qmd

2) Logistic Regression
- Outcome variable: dmdx (binary: 1 = diabetes, 0 = non-diabetes)
- Identify risk factors associated with the diagnosis of diabetes
- File: logistic regression.qmd
